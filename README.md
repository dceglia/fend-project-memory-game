# Memory Game Project

## General

Welcome to my Udacity FEND Project 2 repository. Starting with the provided HTML, CSS and using provided resources, I finally built functional JavaScript on my 3rd attempt. It's been a challenging 3 weeks but I've learned a lot and gained a good deal of confidence from this project.

## Instructions for Students prior to Beginning

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How To

The memory game is played by flipping cards over 2 at a time. When a match is found those cards remain face up. When all cards are face up the player has won and the game has completed.

## Contributing

This repository is my attempt at Project 2 as a Udacity FEND student. Therefore, the project is currently not open for contribution.
